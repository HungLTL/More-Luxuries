## Inspiration
The idea itself is not mine, I was inspired to create this mod while playing civilization 5 on a computer with the "More Luxuries" mod.

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION
### COMPATIBILITY
- The mod works on the Base Version and Gods & Kings.
- Support Palette: FantasyHex & HexaRealm.
- Support Mod (100%): Ukraine Mod, More Pantheons - Addon.
- Incompatible with scenarios by other players.

### RECOMMENDED
- Install the mod add-on: **"More Pantheons - Addon"**.
- Install the mods **"Civ 5 Icons"** and **"Civ V Leader portraits"**.

The extra luxuries work really well with the larger-sized terra maps. Please make sure you don't use other mods that add luxury resources to avoid crashes and bugs. Most mods which add more city-state luxuries shouldnâ€™t cause problems with this mod.

You can use this mod in your own mods without the author's permission, just leave a link to the author/mod in the description of your mod.
